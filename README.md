# Vulnerability and Control Verification Interface (VCVI-Tool)  
### Status: *Work in Progress*

Hi! This is my project for creating a tool called **VCVI-Tool** (Vulnerability and Control Verification Interface). Itâ€™s designed to help with **red teaming** tasks like finding vulnerabilities, testing security controls, and simulating attacks.  

> built using **Golang** for its speed and networking capabilities


### Planned features include:  
| Tools | [/] |
|-------|------|
| Password Manager |  |
| Port Scanner |  |
| Network Sniffer |  |  
| Web Vulnerability Scanner |  |
| Log Analyzer |  |
| Encryption Tool |  |
| Password Cracker|  |
| Honeypot |   |
| Phishing Simulator |  |
| API Tester |   |

It will also connect with **Metasploit** to do things like reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation testing.
